        <p>Asteroids come in three main types: type c, type s, and type m. Type c asteroids are generally carbonaceous and make up over 75% of all known asteroids. In addition they are made of hydrogen, helium and other volatile elements. The next, type s, are siliceous, accounting for around 17% of all known asteroids. These asteroids are more metallic, being made up of iron and magnesium silicates. Finally type m asteroids include the rest of known asteroids. They are made out of iron and are located in the asteroid belt’s middle region. Some of the asteroids travel close to Earth, away from the asteroid belt, these are known as NEAs. These are typically only a little over a hundred million miles away from Earth. Over two hundred and fifty have been found up to date however according to NASA, that is “probably only a few percent of their total population”. Because of their abundance and close proximity to Earth, we have a much easier opportunity to utilize these asteroids than we would otherwise.</p>

        <p>Currently the main focus of space exploration has been on exiting Earth’s atmosphere, for two reasons. First because it is the first step to everything else, and second because it’s so hard to do. We have had many breakthroughs however. Many of them come from the private sector. SpaceX for example has been experimenting with the world's first fully reusable rocket the Falcon 9. Similarly Blue Origin has been trying to reduce cost of space exploration by creating a reusable rocket design of their own. </p>
