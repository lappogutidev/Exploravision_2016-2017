        <p>	Our goal is to encourage space exploration and utilization by reducing the cost associated with transport. We plan to do this by expanding off of NASA’s idea of mining asteroids, using a Nerva engine to essentially turn an asteroid into one giant fuel tank. Great quantities of resources can be gained through the utilization of the three main types of asteroids: carbonaceous, siliceous, and metallic . We have the opportunity to harness these vast quantities of resources bring a large boost to the economy as well as scientific advancements. Our idea, is to separate asteroids into their basic components and turn that into fuel to both separate it further as well as transport the mined material. This will hopefully eliminate the main costs of space exploration/utilization. We have to be able to think out of the box if we ever hope to explore space… the final frontier.</p>
